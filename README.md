# TMDB-Movie-Dataset-Analysis
Welcome! This repository contains my movie data analysis project based on data extracted from **TMDB (The Movie Database)** using their API.

## Project Overview

- I collected a dataset of around **10,000 movies** from the TMDB website using their official API.
- The data contains movies from 1915 up to 2025—over a century of film!
- The dataset includes details like:
  - Movie title
  - Popularity score
  - Average rating
  - Number of votes
  - Release year
  - Overview/summary
  - Original language
  - And more

## How I Did It

- **Step 1: Data Extraction**
  - Used the TMDB API to download movie data directly from the source.
  - Example: "Downloading popular movies, their ratings, and release years using Python scripts."

- **Step 2: Data Analysis**
  - Loaded the data into Python and analyzed it with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  - Focused on **question-based analysis**—each section tackles a real-world question about movies.

## Example Analysis Questions

- *Which are the most popular movies in the dataset?*
- *How has the number of movies released changed over the years?*
- *Which languages are most common among popular movies?*
- *Are movies with higher ratings also more popular?*

## Example Findings

- **Top 10 Most Popular Movies** (as of data extraction):
  - Lilo & Stitch
  - A Minecraft Movie
  - Final Destination Bloodlines
  - Sikandar
  - A Working Man
  - Until Dawn
  - Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning
  - Fountain of Youth
  - Fear Street: Prom Queen
  - Sinners

> 🎬 *Imagine you’re recommending movies to friends. This analysis helps you spot the hottest releases, classics, or hidden gems based on real numbers and trends!*
